**Accumulative Dose**

A choose your own adventure game.

# Project Improvements
1. I need to add a .gitignore.
2. I could make it longer by adding more tools and more stories.
3. Players should have the right tool to escape or have to backtrack.
4. I would like to see unique background images for each page.
5. I could redo the whole thing and turn it into a React project and use hook to dry out the code.

# About the Project
1. The first page:
   * Play starts with a start **button** and a brief explanation.
   * A **button** that links to an about page, and links back to the first page.
   * A **button** that links to a how to page, and links back to the first page.
   * A start **button**.

2. The second page:
   * A dosimeter in the top right keeping track of accumulative exposure to radiation.
   * A items list.
   * Two **buttons** to choose form that move the character to the next page.
   * A story / description of where is, what the charter is feeling, and what they see.

3. Play continues:
   * Different pages are loaded depending on the choice of the player.
   * Items accumulated will aid (or not) the player along the way.
   * The dose meter continues to go up depending on the path and items.

2. Ending:
   * When you reach the exit and have not accumulated a lethal dose of radiation.
